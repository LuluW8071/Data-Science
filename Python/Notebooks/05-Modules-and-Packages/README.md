# Modules and Packages

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be used in other Python scripts. In Python Modules can be imported using the `import` statement followed by the module name. Once the module is imported, you can access its functions and variables using `dot` notation.

A package is simply a way of organizing modules into directories and sub-directories, making it easier to manage large-scale Python projects.
