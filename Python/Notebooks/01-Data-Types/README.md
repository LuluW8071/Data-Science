## Data Types Assignment

Write a Python program that reads in a long text (150 or more words) and performs the following operations:

1. Creates a list of all words in the text.
2. Creates a dictionary that maps each unique word to the number of times it appears in the text.
3. Creates a set of all unique words in the text.
4. Prints out the five most common words in the text and their frequency.

Here are some additional requirements and suggestions:

- You may assume that the text contains only ASCII characters and that words are separated by whitespace.
- You may use any built-in data structures in Python (such as lists, dictionaries, and sets) to implement the program.
- You may use the collections module to simplify the implementation of the word frequency dictionary.
- You may use the re module to preprocess the text and remove non-alphabetic characters.
- You may use the sorted function to sort the words by frequency.
- You may define helper functions as necessary to implement the program.
