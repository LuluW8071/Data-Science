# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is centered around objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. In Python, everything is an object, including integers, strings, lists, and functions. Python's support for OOP is a key feature of the language that makes it powerful and flexible.
