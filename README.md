# Data-Science

Welcome to the Data Science Repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of topics ranging from **Git** fundamentals and **Python** basics to advanced concepts, including **Machine Learning** algorithms, **Deep Learning** for computer vision using **PyTorch**, and **OpenCV**. These topics will be constantly updated as this repository serves as a record of my ongoing learning and understanding.
