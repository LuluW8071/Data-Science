# OpenCV

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to getting started with **OpenCV** in Python. We cover the fundamental concepts of OpenCV, including reading images and videos, performing image transformations, drawing shapes and text, and advanced topics like color spaces, masking, edge detection, and face detection/recognition.

## Getting Started

To begin with, ensure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using a virtual environment for this project. Here's how to check your Python version:

```bash
py --version
```
*Note: Ensure your Python version is just below the latest release for compatibility with OpenCV.*

If you haven't installed OpenCV and Caer yet, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python caer
pip install matplotlib
```
