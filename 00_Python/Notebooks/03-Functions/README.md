# Python Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout a program. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword in python, followed by the function name and any parameters the function takes. Follow along with notebooks for more information.

A method is a function that is associated with an object. It allows you to perform actions on the object or manipulate its data in some way. Methods can be called on any object of a particular class or data type. While talking about data-types in our previous lecture, we also talked about methods associated with respective data-type. Follow each data-type's notebook to know the methods of corresponding data-type.

## Python Functions Assignment

Write a Python program that reads a list of integers from the user and does the following:

1. Use the built-in function `map` and a `lambda` expression to square each number in the list.
2. Use a user-defined function called `calculate_sum` to compute the sum of the squared numbers.
3. Use the built-in function `filter` and a `lambda` expression to remove all odd numbers from the original list.
4. Use a user-defined function called `find_max` to find the maximum value in the filtered list.
5. Print the sum of the squared numbers and the maximum value in the filtered list.

Your program should handle the following cases:

- If the user enters an empty list, your program should print an error message and terminate.
- If the user enters a list that contains non-integer values, your program should print an error message and terminate.
