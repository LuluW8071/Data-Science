    "# Python Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, comprehensions provide a concise way to create sequences like lists, dictionaries, and sets. They are a more readable and often more efficient alternative to using traditional loops to generate sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of comprehensions in Python: list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, list comprehension is a concise way to create lists. It provides a compact syntax for mapping a given iterable (e.g. list, tuple) to a new list by applying a specific expression to each element in the original iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this syntax, `expression` is the operation to be performed on each item in the iterable, `item` is the variable that represents each element in the iterable, and `condition` is an optional filter that can be applied to select only certain elements from the iterable.\n",
