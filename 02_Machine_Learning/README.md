**Machine learning** is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions.

In machine learning, systems are designed to 
- learn from data, 
- identify patterns, and 
- make decisions or predictions based on that data.

The core idea behind machine learning is to enable computers to learn from experience, just like humans do, but at a much larger scale and with computational efficiency. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and relationships within the data. These algorithms then use this learned knowledge to make predictions or decisions when presented with new, unseen data.

Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types:

### Supervised Learning:

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is associated with a corresponding output or target label. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

### Unsupervised Learning: 

Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find patterns or structure within the data without explicit guidance. Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

### Reinforcement Learning: 

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its goal is to learn the optimal policy that maximizes long-term rewards.
